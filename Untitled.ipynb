    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- Li0.5MnO3 has three different Wyckoff positions 2b, 2c and 4h in the C2/m model. \n",
    "- Going from Li2MnO3 to Li1.5MnO3 the charge is mostly compensetate by oxidation of oxygen. Simullar resluts were found going to Li1MnO3.\n",
    "- Li0.5MnO3 in the 4h configuration transforms into the O1 stacking, P3-1m, and had the lowest energy by 0.31 eV (between 2b and 2c the difference was 0.03 eV). \n",
    "- During (dis)charging the first lithium to be removed is from the lithium layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VASP details:\n",
    "- LDAUU = 5.0\n",
    "- ENCUT = 400\n",
    "- EDIFG = 10^-3\n",
    "- Monkhorst-Pack with 0.05 A density\n",
